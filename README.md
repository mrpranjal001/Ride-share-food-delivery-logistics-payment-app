# Ride Share & Food Delivary 


This app has a lot of uber cool features and services. Here's everything you can do with it. 

You can choose one from three: GoRide, GoCar, or GoBluebird. When you’re lost? GoTransit is here to save your day and provide you with the choices of convenient routes.

Hungry? We have GoFood, the service for food delivery. When you’re bored at home and want to explore the best cuisine in your city, try GoFood pickup and pay your food with GoPay to minimize human contact.
